OctoStatus is a status bar widget for OS X. The idea is to have it talk to [OctoPrint](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint) and give feedback on the status of what OctoPrint is doing. Specifically, the intention is to get time remaining on prints and information on any errors that may have occurred.

## What it does

Right now it just reports the printer's current status and currently loaded file(if one is loaded). Not exciting, but with further testing I am hoping to make it way more useful.

## What I'd like it to do

Basically I want it to display the print time left right in the status bar. In the context menu I'd like it to display some details regarding the current print.

Eventually I'd like to be able to kick off or cancel prints, but figuring out how to do that in a good way will be tricky.

## What can you do

I'd love to get people testing this out. If you can't build it, I'd be happy to try and help any way I can, just drop me a message in Github and I can try and get you a pre-made binary.
