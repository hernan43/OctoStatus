# OctoStatus

OctoStatus is (going to be) a staus bar widget for OS X. The idea is to have it talk to [OctoPrint](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint) and give feedback on the status of what OctoPrint is doing. Specifically, the intention is to get time remaining on prints and information on any errors that may have occurred.

This project is pretty much a vehicle for me to learn how to do [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) programming and also to learn a bit more about OS X programming in general.
